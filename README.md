# KVC DualNet Approach
This repository publishes the demo code for the 5th (desktop task) and the 3rd (mobile task) solutions at [IEEE BigData2023 Keystroke Verification Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/bida-kvc/).
This repository houses the training code for the Dual-Network approach that was proposed by Y. Yamagishi.

## Codebase

The code is a modified version of the starter kit, which can be found at this URL: [Kick Start Scripts for the Keystroke Verification Challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/bida-kvc/kick-start-scripts?authuser=0).
